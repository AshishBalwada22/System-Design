1) Can databases be in memory?
chance of loosing data over a period of time.

2) In-memory database = cache

3) How do databases store data?
hardware -> magnetic tape, solid state disk

4) Algorithm used when storing data?
In relational database, B+ Tree are used.
pages, hashtables, pointers
Relational DB -> queried using sql
Other DB are queried by NOSQL(key, value) stores

Databases are usually consistent, available to incoming request, single source of truth

5) Graph database
store data internally as nodes and edges
used to perform graph queries efficiently
Enable user to perform graph operation in relaational DB

6) Time-series DB
stores record that are part of time-series
Aggregate & compress time-stamped data.
few time series DB are written on top of relational DB

7) object oriented Database
work with objects
implemented using relational DB


8) what database should you choose?
POSTGRE -> consistency, durability, read replice (if down) but no availability.
casandra -> cluster architecture, availability(if on of the nodes goes down, rest of the node will take responsibility), fault tolerance, not consistent.
